bwip-js is a translation to native JavaScript of the amazing code provided in [Barcode Writer in Pure PostScript](https://github.com/bwipp/postscriptbarcode).  The translated code can run on any modern browser or JavaScript-based server framework.

The software has encoding modules for over 100 different barcode types and standards.
All linear and two-dimensional barcodes in common use (and many uncommon
ones) are available.  Barcode images are generated as png (node-js) or to a canvas (browser)
or as SVG (all platforms).

This is a platform-specific readme stub.  See the main project's readme at [Barcode Writer in Pure JavaScript](https://github.com/metafloor/bwip-js).
